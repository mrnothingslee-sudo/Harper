## Harper Privacy Policy

By using Harper, you agree to the following policies listed below. It is highly recommended that you read the following policies listed below to make sure you understand everything listed. If you have any questions or need any help, you can join our [support server](https://discord.gg/bwS6Zvfc8G).

## Data Collection
Harper collects certain data such as user IDs, channel IDs, and server IDs in order to power most of its features and to block any blocked individuals or groups from using the bot. Harper also collects message content for autoMod command to scans for toxic messages, and for moderation logs (which can only be setup by server managers). All data collected is kept for no longer than fifteen (15) to thirty (30) days at a time, and all stored data is kept on protected servers. While storage methods vary, most data is kept within password-protected databases such as [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com). Please keep in mind that even with these protections, no data can ever be 100% secure. All efforts are taken to keep your data secure and private, but its absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## Caveats
When requesting data deletion, certain data will not be deleted for anti-abuse reasons. The data that will not be deleted includes all types of internal infractions stored, user and/or server blacklists, and your server's antispam countermeasure statuses (any previous warnings encountered with the antispam will not be deleted). For all other aspects of the bot, you can expect your data to be removed in fourteen (14) days or less

## Routine Data Purges
In an effort to reduce the amount of data we store, data is regularly purged from our systems. Each type of data is purged at different intervals, so not all data is treated the same. Snipe command data is purged every other hour and other commands that store message content (such as scan) removes the data almost immediately after the command is executed. For stored channel and webhook IDs, they are purged every fourteen (14) days to one (1) month.

## Data Removal
To request data removal, you can join [Home Of Failures](https://discord.gg/bwS6Zvfc8G) to request or DM `toilatiba#4443` if you don't want to join the server.
